Storyline A — “The Ember & the Engine”
	•	Hook: Vianne flees a massacre; René Lysandre is targeted by the Ashen Directorate for his Luneborn blood—which can “tune” a machine that bends memory.
	•	Machinet’s past: Built by the Lumière Accord (the good guys) to intercept ether-telegraphs, seized by the Directorate, rewired into the Echo Engine to erase resistance cells from their own histories. The Engine overheated and “forgot” its operators; they walked out into the rain and never returned.
	•	Inside: Posters scabbed with new slogans, corridors lined with headset racks still warm from phantom use; you hear conversations that already happened.
	•	Goal: Vianne must retune the Echo Engine to remember René’s trail instead of erasing it. Doing so wakes the bunker spirits (recorded voices, looped boots).
	•	Ending beat: The Engine identifies a final operator—Warden-Unit “Marche”—who locked René’s location behind a phrase only “the one who remembers” can speak. Vianne must become the Warden for one minute… and risks losing a memory she can’t spare.

I would like to add the master evil character called the saint that is a high rank in the directorate
